Built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) (ES6 version) and a [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) backend for some nice realtime data. Build setup with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Latest version (v4) in the never ending re-write of [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/v4) used, probably unwisely.
